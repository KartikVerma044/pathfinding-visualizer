Used React JS to visualize  the Astar and Dijsktra algorithm showing the
sets of visited and unvisited nodes on a weighted undirected graph

# Algorithm-Visualizer
A web application to visualize various pathfinding algorithms on a Grid

Installation
Cloning the repository:
Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/hsureka/pathfinding-visualizer.git
Installing dependencies:
Run npm install
Starting the server:
Run npm start.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


Positioning the start and end node
You can move the start and end node to which ever cell you want by dragging and dropping



Adding walls
Firstly, make sure you the the rightmost yellow button as Toggle (Node Type=Wall)
You can add walls to which ever cells you want by clicking the mouse and dragging it and the same goes for removing them
You can also toggle between wall cell and normal cell

Adding Weighted Nodes
Firstly, make sure you the the rightmost yellow button as Toggle (Node Type=Weighted(6))
You can add weighted node to which ever cells you want by clicking the mouse and dragging it and the same goes for removing them
You can also toggle between wall cell and normal cell

Generation of Path
Generate the path using whichever algorithm you want by clicking on the corresponding button

Visualization of Path
Visualize the generated path by clicking the Visualize Path Button

For example these are the visualized paths for the A-Star and Dijkstra Algorithm

After visualization
After visualization you can reposition start and end node as you want and add and delete walls as you wish and visualize using any algorithm again without reloading the webpage
